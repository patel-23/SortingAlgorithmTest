# SortingAlgorithmTest
The purpose of these tests was to explore different run time for sorting algorithms in Java given different types of data sets. Arrays of various sizes with various orders of information were generated and fed to each algorithm to analyze time complexity. A report containing a summary of my findings has been included.
